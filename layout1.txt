# Width, Height, XPos, and YPos are all ratios with 1 being the full screen height/width. 
# So for example "Window 0.5 0.5 0 0" would make a window half the screen width and screen height at the top left of the screen
# "Window" Width Height XPos YPos

Window 1 0.5 0 0
Window 0.5 0.5 0 0.5
Window 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5
