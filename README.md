This is for Macos and you MUST have Firefox, unless you want to do something to the code to make it work for something else

***SETUP***
To make this work download the files and then cd into the folder from the terminal

Then paste in "python3 multi-window-image-collage". It will ask for permissions, accept them and then the next time it will work as expected.

***USAGE***
To use it you can run the script through 
"python3 multi-window-image-collage ***INSERT IMAGE LINK HERE*** ***INSERT LAYOUT.txt HERE***"
If you leave the layout blank it will default to layout1.txt

You can use your own files from your computer or from the web

From the web:
Right click the image you want and press "copy image link"

From a image on your computer:
Right click the image you want in finder while pressing the option key and press "Copy "filename" as Pathname"
