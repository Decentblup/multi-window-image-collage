This is for Macos and you MUST have Firefox, unless you want to do something to the code to make it work for something else

***SETUP***
To make this work download the files and then cd into the folder from the terminal

Then paste in "python3 multi-window-image-collage". It will ask for permissions, accept them and then the next time it will work as expected.

***USAGE***
To use it you can run the script through 
"python3 multi-window-image-collage <INSERT IMAGE LINK HERE> <INSERT LAYOUT.txt HERE>"
